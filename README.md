# Advanced Machine Learning Portfolio
This portfolio includes three machine learning projects I conducted in Spring 2021 for the advanced machine learning class at Columbia University. These projects analyzes real-world probelms with deep learning and neural networks algorithms. Different types of data were adopted, including tabular, image, and text data. Supervised machine learning models were applied to select key features, identify patterns, and generate evaluation metrics.
